			London-based designer Martino Gamper talks about his designs for Italian luxury accessories brand Valextra, and Italian architect Marco Costanzi discusses Milanese design influences for the brand's first New York flagship, which recently opened on Madison Avenue. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Martino Gamper:I first met the Valextra team at "Design is a State of Mind," the exhibition I curated at London's Serpentine Galleries last spring, but when Valextra first contacted me, I had already known of the brand for many years. l'd walked past the shop and vitrines in Milan on Via Manzoni, looking in, thinking, "Ah, maybe one day," but 14 always felt like was too young to design a bag. Though work with leather-it's a material I really love-l'd never done a bag before. I asked if I could go to the factory and see how things are made, all the labor and love that is put into each bag.
			<br>
			<br>
			The lines on the edges are made of ink. The technique is very complicated-there's a little brush, and you have to apply the lacquer seven times to create the tosta" piping on the edges of the leather. I saw all the different materi- als and colors, and really felt it was so monochrome in a way, so I wanted to bring in some more color. At the same time, I didn't want to redesign the bag because I thought I wasn't quite ready yet. It's interesting to take something that already exists and work on it, and to try to work within that condition. 
			<br>
			<br>
			There are several products we've developed, and we're going to try to develop others. There will be a similar motif, and similar colors, but we'll also try to work with more masculine colors as well, and see what we can do for a more contemporary, younger audience. It's also something that Valextra and I are playing with now: We can do custom bags within our color range.

			I said to Valextra that l'm very interested in establish- ing a relationship in which we can continuously create, rather than having to create this one thing that's going to be a classic, because you don't really design a classic: A classic becomes that way because people believe in it, and buy it-then it becomes a classic over time. You can't design a classic: it's impossible. You need time to define it. It's an ongoing conversation with the company that I find very exciting.

			Marco Costanzi: With this store, we chose the most Milanese materials and furniture pieces possible. The stone you see everywhere is Ceppo di Gré, a stone from the region between Bergamo and Brescia that you nor- mally find in Milan. It's very common, but still has that fresh look of Milan, of Bocconi University. It's also something very monumental, but I try to balance it perfectly with the Paonazzo marble, leather, and brass. Then we have this Chinese paper on the wall, which is something very rich and special. 
			<br>
			This project was difficult because the original store in Milan was designed by the very important architect Pierluigi Cerri. In New York, the chairs were designed by Luigi Caccia Dominioni, a very important Milanese architect. The door handles are by Giò Ponti, and the lighting is by Viabizzuno. It was important to have a concept that would be very modern, but not too rich, because we wanted the bags themselves to have the capacity to breathe, to speak their own language.
